## 🧑‍💻 About Me

My journey into technology didn’t begin with memorizing syntax or chasing trends — it began with curiosity. I wanted to understand how everyday applications work behind the scenes and how ideas transform into functional systems.

As a Computer Science undergraduate, I’ve spent my time exploring the full lifecycle of software development: from building intuitive user interfaces to designing backend logic and APIs, and experimenting with machine learning to add intelligence to applications. Along the way, I learned that good software is less about complexity and more about **clarity, structure, and thoughtful problem-solving**.

I enjoy working across the full stack because it allows me to think holistically — balancing user experience with system performance. Whether I’m debugging a backend service, refining a frontend interaction, or training an ML model, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding the *why* behind every decision.

I believe growth comes from consistent effort, real-world projects, and learning deeply rather than quickly. My goal is to build software that is reliable, meaningful, and continuously improving — one project at a time.

> _Learn deeply. Build intentionally. Improve continuously._
